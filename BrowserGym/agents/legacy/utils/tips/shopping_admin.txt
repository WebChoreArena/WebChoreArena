Here are tips for using this website:
1. When you add a new product in the CATALOG > Products tab, you can click the downwardarrow beside the "Add Product" button to select options like "Simple Product", "Configurable Product", etc.
2. If you need to add new attribute values (e.g. size, color, etc) to a product, you can find the product at CATALOG > Products, search for the product, edit product with "Configurable Product" type, and use "Edit Configurations" to add the product with new attribute values. If the value that you want does not exist, you may need to add new values to the attribute.
3. If you need to add new values to product attributes (e.g. size, color, etc), you can visit STORES > Attributes > Product, find the attribute and click, and add value after clicking "Add Swatch" button.
4. You can generate various reports by using menus in the REPORTS tab. Select REPORTS > "report type", select options, and click "Show Report" to view report.
5. In this website, there is a UI that looks like a dropdown, but is just a 1-of-n selection menu. For example in REPORTS > Orders, if you select "Specified" Order Status, you will choose one from many options (e.g. Canceled, Closed, ...), but it's not dropdown, so your click will just highlight your selection (1-of-n select UI will not disappear).
6. Configurable products have some options that you can mark as "on" of "off". For example, the options may include "new", "sale", "eco collection", etc.
7. You can find all reviews and their counts in the store in MARKETING > User Content > All Reviews. If you see all reviews grouped by product, go REPORTS > By Products and search by Product name.
8. This website has been operating since 2022. So if you have to find a report for the entire history, you can select the date from Jan 1, 2022, to Today.
9. Do not export or download files, or try to open files. It will not work.
